📘 Question (Algebra): Given x = 3 and y = 2, find the value of the expression $\frac{4x^2}{9y^2}$

🧩 Gemini Explanation:

Hello there! Let's break down this algebra problem step-by-step. Don't worry, we'll go through it together, and I'll explain everything clearly.

Our goal is to find the value of the expression $\frac{4x^2}{9y^2}$ when we know that $x = 3$ and $y = 2$.

---

### Step-by-step reasoning:

**Step 1: Understand the Goal - Substitution**
Our first step in these kinds of problems is always to *substitute* the given numerical values for the variables in the expression. Think of it like a fill-in-the-blanks game! We're replacing 'x' with '3' and 'y' with '2'.

**Step 2: Substitute the value of 'x' into the expression**
Let's start with the 'x' part. We are given $x = 3$. In our expression, 'x' appears as $x^2$.
So, wherever we see 'x', we'll put '3' in its place.
The numerator becomes $4 \times (3)^2$.
*It's a good habit to use parentheses when substituting, especially with exponents, to make sure we don't make any mistakes!*

**Step 3: Calculate $x^2$**
Now, let's figure out the value of $3^2$.
Remember, $3^2$ means $3 \times 3$.
So, $3^2 = 9$.
Our numerator is now $4 \times 9$.

**Step 4: Substitute the value of 'y' into the expression**
Next, let's do the same for 'y'. We are given $y = 2$. In our expression, 'y' appears as $y^2$.
So, wherever we see 'y', we'll put '2' in its place.
The denominator becomes $9 \times (2)^2$.

**Step 5: Calculate $y^2$**
Similar to 'x', let's figure out the value of $2^2$.
Remember, $2^2$ means $2 \times 2$.
So, $2^2 = 4$.
Our denominator is now $9 \times 4$.

**Step 6: Put everything back into the expression**
Great job! Now we have all the pieces. Let's substitute these calculated values ($x^2=9$ and $y^2=4$) back into our original expression:
The expression $\frac{4x^2}{9y^2}$ becomes $\frac{4 \times 9}{9 \times 4}$.

**Step 7: Perform the multiplications**
Now, let's multiply the numbers in the numerator (the top part of the fraction) and the denominator (the bottom part).
*   **Numerator:** $4 \times 9 = 36$.
*   **Denominator:** $9 \times 4 = 36$.
So, our expression simplifies to $\frac{36}{36}$.

**Step 8: Simplify the fraction**
What happens when the numerator and denominator are the same?
When you have the same non-zero number in both the numerator and denominator, the fraction simplifies to 1.
$\frac{36}{36} = 1$.

### The Final Answer:

The value of the expression $\frac{4x^2}{9y^2}$ when x = 3 and y = 2 is **1**.

### A Short Intuitive Explanation:

Think of it like this: We started with an expression that had letters (variables) and numbers. Our task was to replace those letters with the specific numbers they stood for. After we substituted the numbers for 'x' and 'y' and calculated their squares, we found ourselves with a fraction where the top part (numerator) was $4 \times 9$ and the bottom part (denominator) was $9 \times 4$. Both of these multiplications give us 36! Any time you divide a number by itself (like 36 divided by 36), the result is always 1. It's like having 36 cookies and sharing them equally among 36 friends – everyone gets exactly 1 cookie!
